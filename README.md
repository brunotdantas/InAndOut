# In-And-Out and Expense Control

## What is the purpose of this Repo? 
Put in practice my skills on ASP.NET MVC creating an application where you can create a control of items that were lended from a person to another. 
An expense control will be created to classify the expense name and what is the Category of that expense.

## What I could learn from this project? 
- How to work with MVC on ASP.NET CORE
- Manage databases with Entity Framework (with SQL SERVER)
- handle form requests and populating views from Models
- Practice bootstrap CSS framework
- Implement full CRUD operations
